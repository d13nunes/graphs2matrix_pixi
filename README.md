#Experiment log:

1. ~~This is my first pixi project so I had no clue on how to setup the environment. So like any good developer I search on google and the first tuturial that I like was this [one](https://medium.com/anvoevodin/how-to-set-up-pixijs-v5-project-with-npm-and-webpack-41c18942c88d) ~~ 
Took to long to step up, was getting to much errors, so after one hours trying I stop this tututial and search for a new one
